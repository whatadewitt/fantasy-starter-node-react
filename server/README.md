# Fantasy Starter App - Server

A simple express app that will allow you to authenticate with Yahoo! and send the user back into your client app with a valid access / refresh token to make queries to the Yahoo! Fantasy API using the `yahoo-fantasy` node wrapper. Please check the `package.json` for any commands you need to run things (though it is meant to be pretty straightforward)
