# Fantasy Starter App - Client

A simple react app that will allow you to authenticate with Yahoo! against your express server. This app is using JSX and vite as a bundler. Please check the `package.json` for any commands you need to run things (though it is meant to be pretty straightforward)

_Make sure you've updated the proxy in the package.json file and removed the server from the vite.config.js file!!_
